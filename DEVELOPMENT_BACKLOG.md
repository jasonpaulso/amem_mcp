### Definition of Done (DoD)
For all user stories:
- Code is written, reviewed by at least one peer, and merged into the main branch.
- Unit tests (80%+ coverage) and integration tests pass.
- Documentation (e.g., API docs, code comments) is updated.
- Acceptance criteria are verified in a staging environment.
- No new security vulnerabilities introduced (scanned via tools like Snyk).
- Story is demonstrable in a sprint review.
Stories are designed to be 1 story point each (estimable as completable in 1 day or less by a mid-level engineer).

### Prioritization Framework
Using RICE (Reach: how many users affected; Impact: value to users/business; Confidence: certainty of estimates; Effort: time/cost, fixed low at ~1 day for these small stories).
- Scores: Reach (1-5), Impact (1-5), Confidence (1-5), Effort (1, normalized).
- RICE Score = (Reach * Impact * Confidence) / Effort.
Prioritization favors Basic features first (MVP must-haves), then Performance, then Excitement. Higher scores indicate earlier sequencing. Explanations provided per story.

### Dependency Overview
- Stories in Basic features (Creation, Retrieval, Error Handling) have minimal dependencies and form the MVP core.
- Performance features (Evolution, Integrations, Configuration) depend on Basic (e.g., Evolution needs Creation/Retrieval).
- Excitement features (Prompt Engineering, Monitoring, Scheduling) depend on Performance and can be parallelized post-MVP.
- External dependencies: LiteLLM and ChromaDB libraries must be version-locked (v1+ and v0.4+ respectively); Claude Code API for integration testing.

### Roadmap Integration
Assuming 2-week agile sprints with a 5-person team:
- **Sprint 1-2 (Aug 2025, Release 1 MVP Prep)**: All Basic feature stories + core Service Integrations and Configuration Management (focus on must-haves for testable core workflows).
- **Sprint 3-4 (Sep-Oct 2025, Release 1 MVP + Release 2 Beta Start)**: Remaining Performance stories (e.g., Evolution) + Prompt Engineering and Monitoring (parallel beta testing).
- **Sprint 5-6 (Nov-Dec 2025, Release 2 Beta + Release 3 GA Prep)**: Advanced Scheduling + optimizations.
- Milestones: End of Sprint 2 - MVP deployable with 80% test coverage; End of Sprint 4 - Beta rollout to 10% users; End of Sprint 6 - GA with KPI monitoring.
This aligns with PRD timeline: Release 1 (Q3 2025), Release 2 (Q4 2025), Release 3 (Q1 2026).
