## Executive Summary
The A-MEM MCP Server is a backend service that enables persistent, AI-driven memory for coding contexts in Claude Code, using LiteLLM for LLM interactions, ChromaDB for vector storage, and embeddings for retrieval and evolution. This PRD builds on the BRD by breaking down requirements into prioritized features using the Kano Model, detailing functional and non-functional specs, mapping user journeys, proposing a modular architecture, defining acceptance criteria in Gherkin syntax, outlining an incremental release roadmap, and managing risks via a RAID log.

Key outcomes: Deliver an MVP that boosts developer productivity by 20-30%, with scalable integrations and resilient operations. Target users include solo developers, team leads, and enterprise admins. Development focuses on core workflows first, with excitement features like proactive memory suggestions to differentiate from competitors.

## Feature Definition & Prioritization
Features are derived from the BRD's business requirements, focusing on core workflows, integrations, configuration, monitoring, and evolution. They are prioritized using the Kano Model:

- **Basic Features** (Must-be; absence causes dissatisfaction, presence is expected):
  - Memory Creation: Construct and store memory notes with embeddings and links.
  - Memory Retrieval: Search and rank relevant memories via vector similarity.
  - Error Handling: Resilient parsing, retries, and circuit breakers for LLM and DB interactions.

- **Performance Features** (Linear; more investment yields proportional satisfaction):
  - Memory Evolution: Analyze and update memory networks for insights and optimizations.
  - Service Integrations: Proxy LLM calls via LiteLLM and vector ops via ChromaDB.
  - Configuration Management: YAML-based configs for models, prompts, and env vars.

- **Excitement Features** (Delighters; unexpected bonuses that drive loyalty):
  - Prompt Engineering: Dynamic template caching and customization for analysis.
  - Monitoring & Observability: Metrics, logging, and tracing for performance tuning.
  - Advanced Scheduling: Event-driven or cron-based evolution triggers.

Prioritization aligns with BRD's MoSCoW: All Basic and Performance features are Must/Should-Have for MVP; Excitement features are Could-Have for later releases.

## Functional & Non-Functional Requirements
### Functional Requirements
For each feature, define what the system does:

- **Memory Creation**:
  - Generate memory notes from user code/context inputs.
  - Create embeddings using selected LLM models.
  - Establish links (e.g., similarity-based) between new and existing memories.
  - Store in ChromaDB with metadata (e.g., timestamps, user IDs).

- **Memory Retrieval**:
  - Accept query inputs (e.g., code snippets) and generate embeddings.
  - Perform vector similarity search in ChromaDB.
  - Rank and filter results based on relevance scores and thresholds.
  - Return top-N memories with links and contexts.

- **Error Handling**:
  - Detect failures in LLM calls or DB operations.
  - Implement retries with exponential backoff.
  - Use circuit breakers to prevent cascading failures.
  - Propagate errors to Claude Code with user-friendly messages.

- **Memory Evolution**:
  - Trigger analysis on memory networks (e.g., via events or schedules).
  - Use LLM prompts to identify patterns, optimizations, or redundancies.
  - Update memories/links (e.g., merge, prune, or enhance).
  - Emit events for changes and log outcomes.

- **Service Integrations**:
  - Proxy LLM requests through LiteLLM with model fallbacks.
  - Initialize and query ChromaDB collections for memory ops.
  - Support JSON-RPC protocol for Claude Code integration.

- **Configuration Management**:
  - Load YAML configs for prompts, models, retries, and thresholds.
  - Override with environment variables.
  - Validate configs on startup.

- **Prompt Engineering**:
  - Manage prompt templates in YAML.
  - Cache compiled prompts for efficiency.
  - Allow user overrides for custom analysis.

- **Monitoring & Observability**:
  - Collect metrics (e.g., latency, error rates) using tools like Prometheus.
  - Implement structured logging (e.g., JSON format).
  - Add tracing for end-to-end request flows.

- **Advanced Scheduling**:
  - Support cron jobs for batch evolutions.
  - Handle event-driven triggers (e.g., post-creation hooks).

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance**:
  - Latency: <1s for retrieval; <5s for evolution per memory.
  - Throughput: Handle 100 concurrent requests/min for MVP; scale to 1,000 with Kubernetes.
  - Resource Usage: Optimize LLM calls to <10% CPU per request; monitor vector DB query times.

- **Security**:
  - Encrypt embeddings and metadata at rest/transit.
  - Authenticate API calls via tokens (e.g., JWT from Claude Code).
  - Comply with GDPR/CCPA: Allow data deletion; anonymize user data.
  - Vulnerability Scanning: Regular scans for dependencies; no unauthenticated endpoints.

- **Scalability**:
  - Horizontal Scaling: Deploy as microservices in Docker/Kubernetes; auto-scale workers.
  - Data Growth: ChromaDB sharding for >1M memories; quota limits per user.
  - Multi-Tenancy: Isolate collections per user/team.

- **Compliance & Reliability**:
  - Uptime: 99.9% with health checks and failovers.
  - Accessibility: API docs compliant with OpenAPI; support for multiple locales in errors.
  - Maintainability: Modular code with tests (>80% coverage); versioned APIs.

## User Workflows & Journeys
User journeys are mapped using User Story Mapping, linking features to personas' goals/tasks. Each journey includes steps, features used, and potential bottlenecks.

### User Story Map Overview

```

- **High-Level Design**: Microservices architecture with MCP as central API gateway. Monolith for MVP, refactor to services later. Cloud-agnostic but optimized for AWS/GCP (e.g., EKS for Kubernetes).
- **Technical Constraints/Dependencies**:
  - Dependencies: LiteLLM (v1+), ChromaDB (v0.4+), Python 3.10+.
  - Constraints: No custom LLM training; API rate limits (mitigate with quotas). Data volume: Limit to 10GB/collection initially.
  - Feasibility: Proven stack; prototype in 2 weeks. Risks: LLM variability → Standardize prompts.

## Acceptance Criteria
Using Gherkin syntax (Given-When-Then) for testable outcomes.

- **Memory Creation**:
  Given a code input and user ID,
  When the create_memory endpoint is called,
  Then a memory note with embedding and links is stored in ChromaDB, and a success response with ID is returned.

- **Memory Retrieval**:
  Given a query embedding,
  When retrieve_memory is invoked,
  Then top-5 ranked memories are returned with scores >0.7, or an empty list if none match.

- **Error Handling**:
  Given an LLM API failure,
  When a retry is attempted (up to 3 times),
  Then the circuit breaker opens after failures, and a fallback error message is sent.

- **Memory Evolution**:
  Given a memory network with 10+ links,
  When evolve_network is triggered,
  Then at least 20% of memories are updated, and events are emitted for changes.

- **Service Integrations**:
  Given a config with fallback models,
  When an LLM call fails,
  Then it switches to the next model, and the response is parsed successfully.

- **Configuration Management**:
  Given invalid YAML,
  When server starts,
  Then it fails with validation errors, preventing runtime issues.

- **Prompt Engineering**:
  Given a custom template,
  When cached and used in analysis,
  Then prompt execution time is <50% of non-cached.

- **Monitoring & Observability**:
  Given a request flow,
  When traced,
  Then end-to-end latency metrics are logged with <5% overhead.

- **Advanced Scheduling**:
  Given a cron schedule,
  When time triggers,
  Then batch evolutions run without overlapping locks.

## Release Strategy & Timeline
Incremental roadmap with phased releases:

- **Release 1 (MVP - Q3 2025, Aug-Sep)**: Basic + Core Performance Features (Creation, Retrieval, Integrations, Error Handling). Dependencies: API keys, dev env. Gating: 80% test coverage.
